UNESCO - Video Training Basics, a Series of Instructional Video Tutorials for the Independent Filmmaker

  


This series of instructional "how to" videos will introduce potential and practicing filmmakers to the elements of independent documentary film production, particularly to its processes and techniques. This series of instructional "how to" videos will introduce potential and practicing filmmakers to the elements of independent documentary film production, particularly to its processes and techniques. With the increasing availability of low cost technologies for both production and post-production, the training material will help fulfill a vital need in democratizing the non - print media. Empowering individuals and communities to produce content will help ensure the generation of a more localized content specific to the needs, values and lifestyles of the individual content provider and the community which he or she represents. Through this series of training modules, UNESCO and its partner, the Public Service Broadcasting Trust (PSBT), intend to support this process by facilitating the democratization of content and by providing basic and easily comprehensible self-training materials that are inexpensively distributed to potential content creators. They will provide a basic, conceptual and technical understanding of the uses and techniques of audio-visual film production with a focus on the independent documentary. If this documentary was used as the framework for the training content is because it represents the most easily distributed, accessible and complete genre to present an alternative case or perspective to that presented by commercially driven or state-run television. This project aims to equip a generation of filmmakers and viewers with the basic tools that are essential in the communication process to use the audiovisual medium effectively in order to demonstrate the plurality of views and issues that form civil society.

  
  


前幾天看了這系列介紹拍攝動態影像的基礎教學影片，分別講述：攝影機拍攝要點、錄音收音注意要點、剪接編輯三大影片製作的技術要點。我自己覺得還蠻受用的，至少對我這種沒有任何訓練的活老百姓，拿著DV時可以再稍微思考，我要的是什麼，如何參考基本的取鏡原則，決定什麼樣的構圖、運鏡方式和述事結構等問題，而不是歡樂聚會地亂拍一通。

  


另一支非技術的影片，則討論了影像的力量、被拍攝者、拍攝者和觀者之間隱藏的權力關係。「記錄片」到底記錄了什麼樣的事實，是導演主觀感情投射挑選出來要讓觀眾所看到的那一面，還是偽左右平衡全面觀照的「客觀」陳述。此外，影片放映的主要管道：電視台、院線，何嘗不是一直掌握在既得勢力上，其能容忍多少質疑主流體系的聲音？真正優秀的政治記錄片不只單純地觀察記錄現象問題，更要誠實映照出導演(影片所有工作者)價值理念中的現實，發出影片獨特的性格和聲音。在這個資訊錯綜關係複雜的世界裏，選擇關懷什麼議題，如何探索其中的問題利害，表達出自己的看法意見，這不只是記錄片導演的使命，也是每一位自覺觀賞者的功課。

  


原檔案要在[UNESOO網站](http://creativecontent.unesco.org/welcome)註冊後才能下載，我本來想把它傳到影片分享網站內嵌，但其 rm real player 格式卻老在最後一個步驟無法完成影片的轉換儲存，所以只好丟在虛擬主機裏讓有興趣的人自己下載。
