六點半左右，搞定了今天預定完成的工作，才有時間看看[樂生事件的最新發展](http://www.coolloud.org.tw/tag/200709%E6%A8%82%E7%94%9F%E5%A4%A7%E9%96%80%E5%8F%A3%E7%8F%BE%E5%A0%B4%E8%B7%91%E9%A6%AC%E7%87%88)。昨晚一夜，不少人在線上進行動員，持續地作著過程後續的記錄報導。然而對於離線的我，那種唯一可以參與的真實就消失了。而此刻，晚上快八點了，不想回家，不去吃飯，依附留戀著線上的黏著感，卻什麼也動不了，什麼也不想做。

  


下午一直在聽Cat Power 2006的專輯[Greatest](http://www.catpowerthegreatest.com/)

  


Once I wanted to be the greatest  
No wind or waterfall could stop me  
And then came the rush of the flood  
The stars at night turned you to dust

  


Melt me down  
To big black armour  
Leave no trace  
Of grace  
Just in your honor  
Lower me down  
That corporate slob  
Make a watch  
For a space in town  
For the lack of the dreds  
Of my bed I've been sleeping  
Lower me down  
Pin me in  
Secure the grounds  
For the later parade

  


Once I wanted to be the greatest  
Two fists of solid rock  
When things I couldn't explain  
Any feelings  
Lower me down  
Pin me in  
Secure the grounds  
For the lack of the drugs  
My faith had been sleeping  
For the later parade

  


Once I wanted to be the greatest  
No wind or water fall could stop me  
And then came the rush of the flood  
The stars at night turned you to dust
